# Overview

The Compliance Registry is a centralized compliance risk management system.  The Registry will simplify and streamline management of the compliance certifications for an organization’s suppliers, vendors, partners and customers (affiliates).  

Today, companies have to reach out one by one to all of the vendors, suppliers and partners in their ecosystems to collect evidence of and validate compliance with relevant regulatory mandates.   Subsequently, as those certifications expire, updated evidence must be collected again. Add to that, the advent of new regulations and compliances and growing connected partnerships, the task becomes burdensome and tedious.

The Compliance Registry (CR) is a global centralized certification database.  CR will simplify the collection and management of a company’s connected partner certification status.    In addition, the tool allows companies to view liabilities imposed by their partners and the evolving risk.
