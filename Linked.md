# My Network

The My Network Search page shows the Affiliate and their current status.  

The My Network Search page shows only documents directly linked to the company (explicitly linked alien companyâ€™s documents and documents belonging to the company). If no document is found, the page suggests trying the search on the GLOBAL network.

Search allows the user to look for company,certification, version and status. It looks for partial matches in these fields other than status (risk). In the case of status, the search looks for an exact match. The search will look for current company documents, public documents, and documents published on the partner network.

The results of the search will be displayed on the My Network page.

Own documents cannot be unlinked.
If a document is unlinked from the Lined page, the document disappears from that page.

When the user uploads and publishes a new document, the document is automatically included in the company network. In some cases, the user uploads the documents by request for another companies.

Requests can be created as a group of requests with up to 10 items per group. Items could be added using ADD ITEM button.

After the user selected a company from the company autocomplete list, the company fields (name, emails, phone) became read-only. To reset the selected company, the user needs to click X icon next to selected company name.

To create a request for a company that is not yet registered, the user does not have to select a company from the company autocomplete list (just to ignore the autocomplete suggestions). In this case, the user can edit the company fields (name, email, phone).

When user creates a new request (or a group of requests), the system schedules sending related notifications in 10 minutes. When a request is sent to an Affiliate, they will create a profile and share their required certificate.

Also user could view contact for any document.
