# My Risk

The dashboard will show the current status of the network’s risk/compliance.  To better understand the network risk, we will operate using four levels of risk.
From that page, a user can navigate to the My Network page, Inbound page, Outgoing page, Documents page.

- Network Strength – the highest risk of all compliances (documents) linked to the company (including own compliances (documents)). 
- Affiliates (Upcoming expirations) – a number of compliances (documents) with high and medium risks, so it shows upcoming expirations for next 0-5 month. The trend arrow shows the direction of change compared to the previous calculated value. 
- Inbound Request – a number of all pending income requests that must be managed by the company. 
- Company – a number of the company request that is not yet provided by its owners (other companies). 
- Inbound Request List – the oldest request that must be uploaded. 
- Network – the list of all compliances (documents) linked to the company (including own compliances (documents)) ordered by the expiration date. 
- Internal - the list of own company compliances (documents) ordered by the expiration date. 
- Network Breakdown – a pie chart of all compliances (documents) linked to the company (including own compliances (documents)) grouped by its types. This card has a flip card (a small arrow at the bottom) that shows the same data set in a bar chart (see on video).
