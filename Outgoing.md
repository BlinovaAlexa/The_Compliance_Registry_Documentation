To reset the selected company, the user needs to click X icon next to selected company name. 

To create a request for a company that is not yet registered, the user does not have to select a company from the company autocomplete list (just to ignore the autocomplete suggestions). In this case, the user can edit the company fields (name, email, phone).

When user creates a new request (or a group of requests), the system schedules sending related notifications in 10 minutes.
